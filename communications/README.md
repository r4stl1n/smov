> The Communications sub-directory

## Overview

The scripts subdirectory contains all communications files in `.msg` and `.srv`.

> **Note**: Currently, the only two communications packages are those used to establish communications with microcontrollers.

A brief presentation of the subdirectories:
* `back_board_msgs/`: The front microcontroller communication package.
* `front_board_msgs/`: Rear microcontroller communication package.
