> The Universal Robot Description Format (URDF) is a language for describing a robot in terms of its links and joints. It is used by rviz to render robots, robot_state_publisher to convert joint states to TF2 transforms, and by Gazebo to simulate a robot. Xacro is a scripting environment for generating URDF files, which allows one to pass parameters from launch files to the URDF, as well as create more modular functions and snippets that can be incorporated into a single larger URDF.

This folder contains the Xacro files for some specific simulations. The meshes are included in the media distribution. This design choice enables me to load these entities from a world file.
