> The Description sub-directory

## Overview

The description sub-directory all the files needed to run a simulation or visualization of the robot in real time, through file extensions `.urdf`, `.xacro` and `.sdf`.

> **Note** : To make file generation easier for you, take a look at the `scripts/` directory to automate and simplify launching.

A brief presentation of the subdirectories :
* `description/`: This subdirectory contains all files used directly for simulation and visualization.
* `media`: This sub-directory contains all the models that will subsequently be generated in a file format compatible with simulation and visualization.
