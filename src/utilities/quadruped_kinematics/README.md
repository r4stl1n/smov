>  This is the version adapted for ROS2 of the quadruped kinematics library, which you can take a look at by clicking [here](https://github.com/vertueux/quadruped_kinematics).

Quadruped kinematics is a C++ library created to handle operations on a quadruped robot. There are no external dependencies like eigen3 or another C++ math library needed.
This project uses `std::vector` to create matrices. You can adapt this library to your needs.
