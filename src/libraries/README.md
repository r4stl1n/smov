> The libraries sub-directory

## Overview

The developer sub-directory contains all tools related to software development on the SMOV robot.

### Why is the library separated into packages ?

It has been separated into small packages simply to facilitate compilation on much less powerful computers (like my Raspberry Pi 3 B+).
