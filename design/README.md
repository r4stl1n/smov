> The Design sub-directory

## Overview

The design subdirectory contains all the files related to the unique SMOV robot concept, and only those files. So don't expect to find files from other robots made by other third parties.

> **Note** : The design files shown are not licensed under the same license as the root file (`LICENSE.md`), theses are under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license.

A brief presentation of the files :
* `smov.stl`: The standard file is compatible with virtually all 3D rendering software for the complete SMOV robot, including all its parts.
* `smov.3mf`: The standard SMOV robot model file, complete with all parts, mainly compatible with Microsoft 3D Builder software (including textures).
